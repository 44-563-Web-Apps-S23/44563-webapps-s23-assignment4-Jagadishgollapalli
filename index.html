          ANDREW. My Nell!

          ELLEN. Nearly a year----

          ANDREW. Now, at last!

          ELLEN. Hold me close, Andy.

          ANDREW. You're better?

          ELLEN. Let's forget--just for now.

          ANDREW. Is he grown much?

          ELLEN. Grown? You should see him! But so ill! What could I do? You
          see----

          ANDREW. I know, I know.

          ELLEN. The money was all gone. They turned me out at the old place, and
          then----

          ANDREW. I know, dear.

          ELLEN. I got sewing, but when the smallpox----

          ANDREW. I have all your letters, Nell. Come, help me to pack.

          ELLEN. What! You're really decided----

          JOEL. [_Approaching._] Hello, Sis!

          ELLEN. [_Absently._] Ah, Joel; that you? [_Eagerly, following_ ANDREW
          _to the knapsack_.] But, my dear----

          ANDREW. Just these few things, and we're off.

          ELLEN. [_Agitated._] Wait, wait! You don't know yet why I've
          come--instead of writing.

          ANDREW. I can guess.

          ELLEN. But you can't; that's--what's so hard! I have to tell you
          something, and then---- [_Slowly._] I must know from your own eyes, from
          yourself, that you wish to do this, Andrew; that you think it is
          _right_.

          ANDREW. [_Gently._] I guessed that.

          ELLEN. This is what I must tell you. It's not just the sickness, it's
          not only the baby, not the money gone--and all that; it's--it's----

          ANDREW. [_Murmurs._] My God!

          ELLEN. It's what all that brings--the helplessness. I've been insulted.
          Andy--[_Her voice breaks._] I want a protector.

          ANDREW. [_Taking her in his arms, where she sobs._] There, dear!

          ELLEN. [_With a low moan._] You know.

          ANDREW. I know. Come, now; we'll go.

          ELLEN. [_Her face lighting up._] Oh! and you _dare_! It's _right_?

          ANDREW. [_Moving from her, with a hoarse laugh._] _Dare?_ Dare I be
          damned by God and all his angels? Ha! Come, we're slow.

          JOEL. Time enough.

          ELLEN. [_Sinking upon_ JOEL'S _knapsack as a seat, leans her head on her
          hands, and looks strangely at_ ANDREW.] I'd better have written, I'm
          afraid.

          ANDREW. [_Controlling his emotion._] Now, don't take it that way. I've
          considered it all.
