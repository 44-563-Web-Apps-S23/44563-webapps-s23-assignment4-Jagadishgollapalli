          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>My Nell!</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p> Nearly a year----</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>Now, at last!</p>

          <h4>ELLEN</h4><p>Hold me close, Andy.</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>You're better?</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>Let's forget--just for now.</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>Is he grown much?</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>Grown? You should see him! But so ill! What could I do? You see----</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>I know, I know.</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>The money was all gone. They turned me out at the old place, and then----</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>I know, dear.</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>I got sewing, but when the smallpox----</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>I have all your letters, Nell. Come, help me to pack.</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>What! You're really decided----</p>

          <h5>JOEL.</h5> <p>[_Approaching._]</p><p>Hello, Sis!</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>[_Absently._]</p><p>Ah, Joel; that you?</p><p>[_Eagerly, following_ ANDREW _to the knapsack_.]</p>
           <p>But, my dear----</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>Just these few things, and we're off.</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>[_Agitated._]</p><p>Wait, wait! You don't know yet why I've come--instead of writing.</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>I can guess.</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>But you can't; that's--what's so hard! I have to tell you</p>
          <p>something, and then---- [_Slowly._] I must know from your own eyes, from</p>
          <p>yourself, that you wish to do this, Andrew; that you think it is _right_.</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>[_Gently._]</p><p>I guessed that.</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>This is what I must tell you. It's not just the sickness, it's</p>
          <p>not only the baby, not the money gone--and all that; it's--it's----</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>[_Murmurs._ My God!]</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>It's what all that brings--the helplessness. I've been insulted.</p>
          <p>Andy--[_Her voice breaks._ I want a protector.]</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>[_Taking her in his arms, where she sobs._]</p><p>There, dear!</p>

          <h4>ELLEN.</h4><p>[_With a low moan._ You know.]</p>

          <h4>ANDREW.</h4><p>[_Controlling his emotion._]</p><p>Now, don't take it that way. I've
            considered it all.</p>
